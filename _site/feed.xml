<p>원래는 티스토리에서 블로그를 운영했었다. (운영 했다기 보단 자료 스크랩이나 버그 기록 정도..)
그렇다면 나는 왜 티스토리에서 GitHub.io로 이사를 했는가?</p>

<p>가장 큰 이유는 환기가 필요했다.
꾸준히 이직 준비를 한 건 아니지만, 3년 동안 1년에 한 번씩은 면접을 보곤 했다.
처음 2년간은 내가 생각해도 수준 미달이어서 1차 면접에서 떨어지는 게 당연했다. 하지만 최근 1년간은 어느 정도 나도 수준이 올라왔다고 생각했고, 면접관님이랑 기술적인 얘기를 주고 받을 정도로 분위기도 괜찮았는데 떨어지니 멘탈 와르르 멘션…(*꒦ິ⌓꒦ີ)</p>

<p>개발자로서 내가 매력적으로 보이려면 어떻게 해야 될까? 고민을 하다가 “기술 블로그를 제대로 운영해보자”라는 생각에 달았다.
기존에 있던 티스토리를 정리할까 하다가 그건 그냥 그대로 두고 github.io에서 기술 블로그를 새로 시작하고자 한다.</p>

<h2 id="githubio를-다른-블로그와-비교했을-때-갖는-장단점">github.io를 다른 블로그와 비교했을 때 갖는 장단점</h2>

<p><strong>장점</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>기술적인 포트폴리오 구축: GitHub.io는 개발자나 프로그래머로서의 기술적인 역량을 보여줄 수 있는 포트폴리오로 활용할 수 있다.</li>
  <li>개발자 커뮤니티와의 상호작용: GitHub.io는 GitHub 플랫폼에 연결되어 있어, 다른 개발자들과 소통하고 협업할 수 있는 환경을 제공한다. 오픈 소스 프로젝트에 기여하거나, 다른 개발자의 코드를 참고하고 피드백을 주고받을 수 있다.</li>
  <li>호스팅 및 안정성: GitHub.io는 GitHub의 서버 인프라를 이용하여 호스팅되므로, 빠른 성능과 안정성을 제공한다. 또한 GitHub는 백업 및 버전 관리 시스템을 갖추고 있어, 작성한 내용을 안전하게 보관하고 이전 버전으로 롤백할 수 있다.</li>
  <li>광고: 블로그에 <strong><a href="https://www.google.com/adsense/start/">Google AdSense</a></strong>를 링크시킴으로써 광고 수익을 기대할 수 있다. 다른 블로그 서비스에서도 일부 지원하지만, GitHub 블로그는 광고 게시 위치를 마음대로 정할 수 있는 등 설정이 더 자유롭다.</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>단점</strong></p>

<ol>
  <li>기술적인 이해 필요: GitHub.io는 GitHub의 저장소와 연동되어 운영되므로, Git과 Markdown 등의 도구 및 형식에 대한 기본적인 이해가 필요하다. 이를 모르는 경우 설정이나 관리에 어려움을 겪을 수 있다.</li>
  <li>검색 엔진 최적화(SEO)의 한계: GitHub.io는 초기에는 검색 엔진 최적화에 취약한 면이 있었으나, 최근에는 GitHub Pages의 업데이트로 인해 SEO에 대한 지원이 개선되었다. 그러나 다른 플랫폼에 비해 SEO 기능이 제한적일 수 있다.</li>
</ol>

<p>가장 큰 단점은 티스토리나 다른 블로그는 기본적으로 에디터를 제공하고, 조회수, 댓글 기능들도 내장되어있지만, github.io는 이 모든 기능을 셀프로 구현해야한다.</p>

<p>그렇다면 왜 github.io를 선택했는가?</p>

<p>가장 큰 이유는 다른 블로그에 비해 자유도가 높기 때문이다. 블로그의 테마(스킨)나 레이아웃부터 폰트, 컬러 등 원한다면 모든 디자인 요소를 본인의 취향껏 변경할 수 있을 뿐만 아니라 다양한 기능도 추가할 수 있기 때문이다.</p>

<p>기술 블로그인 만큼 여러 기능을 담아볼 생각이다.(포부는 원대하였으나..)</p>

<p>github.io로 블로그를 생성하면서 꽤 헤맸기 때문에 블로그를 생성하는 과정을 이곳에 간단하게 정리해보겠다.</p>

<h2 id="githubio-블로그-만드는-방법"><a href="http://github.io">github.io</a> 블로그 만드는 방법</h2>

<p>(mac m1환경 기준)</p>

<p><strong>1. github에서 새로운 repository 생성</strong></p>

<p><img src="/img/posts/post-01/01.png" alt="01.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>username에는 사이트 이름을 넣으면 된다. 예를 들어 repository name을 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">beforesol.github.io</code> 로 지정하면 블로그 주소는 <a href="https://beforesol.github.io">https://beforesol.github.io</a> 가 된다.</p>

<p>추가로, 누구나 블로그를 볼 수 있도록 public으로 설정해야된다.</p>

<p><strong>2. 원하는 테마 선택</strong></p>

<p>나는 Clean Blog 테마를 사용했다. 아래 링크에 들어가면 다양한 테마가 있으니, 취향에 맞는 테마를 선택하면 된다.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/free">https://jekyllthemes.io/free</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">https://jekyllthemes.io/theme/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll</a></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>3. 내 저장소에 테마 부트스트랩 복사 붙여넣기 하기</strong></p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll">https://github.com/StartBootstrap/startbootstrap-clean-blog-jekyll</a></p>

<p>해당 저장소에 있는 모든 파일을 beforesol.github.io 폴더에 전부 붙여 넣기 한다.(git으로 테마가 제공된다면 해당 저장소를 fork 따서 repostory 이름을 <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">username.github.io</code>로 바꿔도 된다.)</p>

<p><strong>4. ruby 설치</strong></p>

<p><strong>4-1. rbenv 설치</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>brew <span class="nb">install </span>rbenv ruby-build
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4-2. ruby version 확인 (현재 사용중인 버전)</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv versions
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4-3. 설치 가능한 버전 확인</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv <span class="nb">install</span> <span class="nt">-l</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4-4. 루비 설치하기</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv <span class="nb">install </span>3.1.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4-5. 루비 버전 바꾸기</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv global 3.1.2
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4-6. 터미널 설정 바꾸기</strong></p>

<p>본인이 무엇을 사용하는지 모르는 사람은 아래 코드를 입력.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">echo</span> <span class="nv">$SHELL</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><img src="/img/posts/post-01/02.png" alt="02.png" width="100%" /></p>

<p>zsh를 사용하니, zsh 설정 파일을 수정해 줘야 한다.</p>

<p>아래의 코드로 설정 파일을 열어 준다.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>vi ~/.zshrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>파일을 열면 아래의 conda initialize 이후에 아래의 명령어를 추가해 준다.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PATH</span><span class="o">={</span><span class="nv">$Home</span><span class="o">}</span>/.rbenv/bin:<span class="nv">$PATH</span> <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="se">\</span>
<span class="nb">eval</span> <span class="s2">"</span><span class="si">$(</span>rbenv init -<span class="si">)</span><span class="s2">"</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>입력하기 위해서는 i 를 눌러서 수정 후 저장하기 위해서는 esc -&gt; :wq-&gt; enter 를 누르면 수정된다.</p>

<p>변경된 파일을 적용시켜 준다.</p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nb">source</span> ~/.zshrc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>4-7. 다시 다운 받기</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem <span class="nb">install </span>bundler
</code></pre></div></div>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>rbenv rehash
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>5. jekyll 다운</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>gem <span class="nb">install </span>jekyll
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>6. 번들 설치</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle <span class="nb">install</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>7. jekyll을 로컬 서버에 띄우기</strong></p>

<div class="language-bash highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bundle <span class="nb">exec </span>jekyll serve
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http://127.0.0.1:4000/</code>을 브라우저에 입력</p>

<p><strong>8. <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.config.yml</code> 수정</strong></p>

<div class="language-yml highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="na">title</span><span class="pi">:</span>              <span class="s">전솔 블로그</span>

<span class="na">instagram_username</span><span class="pi">:</span>  <span class="s">before_sol</span>
<span class="na">linkedin_username</span><span class="pi">:</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>9. 변경된 내용을 원격 저장소에 push</strong></p>

<div class="language-jsx highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code><span class="nx">git</span> <span class="nx">add</span> <span class="p">.</span>
<span class="nx">git</span> <span class="nx">commit</span> <span class="o">-</span><span class="nx">m</span> <span class="dl">"</span><span class="s2">start clean vlog</span><span class="dl">"</span>
<span class="nx">git</span> <span class="nx">push</span> <span class="nx">origin</span> <span class="nx">main</span>
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>10. <a href="https://beforesol.github.io">https://beforesol.github.io</a> 에서 확인</strong></p>

<p>push를 한다고 바로 반영되는게 아니라 2~3분 있다가 반영이 된다. 인내심을 갖고 기다렸다가 변경된 것을 확인한다.</p>

<h2 id="앞으로의-다짐">앞으로의 다짐</h2>

<p>추후에 Google Search Console, Google Analytics, Google Adsense도 붙여서 블로그를 디벨롭 해나가야겠다.</p>

<p>블로그도 새로 만들었으니, 주 1회 포스팅을 목표로 잡고 열심히 업로드 해야겠다.
앞으로는 적당히만 하지 않고 열심히 잘 해야지.</p>

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine.

<p>As we got further and further away, it [the Earth] diminished in size. Finally it shrank to the size of a marble, the most beautiful you can imagine. That beautiful, warm, living object looked so fragile, so delicate, that if you touched it with a finger it would crumble and fall apart. Seeing this has to change a man.</p>
